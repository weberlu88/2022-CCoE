In this malware attack activity, the initial method involves the execution of a function called "get_executable_name," which reads the symlink "/proc/self/exe" using the "readlink(..)" function. The backdoor then proceeds to gather various data, including CPU information, memory statistics, and the IP address of the infected machine. It retrieves information from files located in the "/proc" directory, such as "/proc/stat," "/proc/meminfo," "/proc/cpuinfo," "/proc/net/dev," "/proc/self/exe," "/proc/self/maps," "/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory," "/proc/sys/kernel/rtsig-max," "/proc/sys/kernel/ngroups_max," "/proc/sys/kernel/osrelease," "/proc/self/fd/%d/%s," "/proc/self/fd," and "/proc/net."
To ensure persistence, the malware modifies the "/etc/rc.local" and "/etc/init.d/boot.local" files. Several string operations, such as using the "sed" command, are employed to modify these files. Additionally, the backdoor opens specific files, including "/etc/host.conf," "/etc/resolv.conf," "/etc/nsswitch.conf," "/etc/suid-debug," and "/etc/ld.so.cache."
The backdoor establishes communication with its command and control (C2) server to receive instructions. The malware establishes a connection to the IP address 23.224.59.34 on port 48080, enabling the attacker to send and receive remote shell commands. The network adapter information is obtained by reading the "/proc/net/dev" file.
This malware employs tactics such as data collection, command and control communication, persistence through file modification, and remote shell interaction to carry out its malicious activities.
