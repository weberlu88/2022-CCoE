      "As a result, Linux systems are left in an insecure state with minimal defenses against malware.\n",
      "This becomes increasingly problematic with the growth of networkable embedded devices often referred to as the “Internet of Things” (IoT).\n",
      "This paper will discuss attack vectors for Linux malware, analyze several pieces of malware and describe defensive capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "None\n",
      "1.\n",
      "Introduction General perception is that Linux operating systems are “Virus free” (Fedora Project, 2012) or that malware is “rare” (Ubuntu, 2015).\n",
      "Linux, Unix and BSD variants comprise approximately 66% of the Internet web servers (W3 Techs, 2015).\n",
      "With a majority share of systems serving websites and other internet traffic, creating malware targeting Linux servers and other devices offers a large, internet_accessible attack service for malware.\n",
      "A security and antivirus vendor reported seeing an average of 27,000 newly compromised websites per day  (Sophos, 2015).\n",
      "Extrapolating the Linux and related Unix variants this could be as many as 17,000 websites compromised per day.\n",
      "The attack surface is also growing quickly: at current estimates nearly 5 billion networked devices are in operation (Gartner, 2014).\n",
      "1.1.\n",
      "Definition of Malware Malware is most often defined as “Code used to perform malicious actions” (SANS Technology Institute, 2015).\n",
      "In order to infect a target, malware must also be able to exploit a vulnerability.\n",
      "This may range from simply enticing a user to execute a file to automated exploitation of specific software vulnerabilities.\n",
      "In many cases malware will contain several functions: code to exploit a particular vulnerability, a payload, a propagation mechanism and command and control functions (Amine, Mohamed, & Benatallah, 2014).\n",
      "2.\n",
      "Gathering Samples Various samples were gathered from an Apache web server hosting the WordPress web application as well as default Apache static content.\n",
      "The internet_facing web server was placed in a segmented Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) to protect internal systems and internal network segments from attack.\n",
      "Egress firewall rules were implemented to prevent command and control traffic from reaching its \n",
      "None\n",
      "intended destination.\n",
      "In order to prevent actual compromise of the web server and application the system was protected by a Apache web server running Modsecurity web application firewall (WAF) configured as a HTTP reverse proxy.\n",
      "The OWASP Core Ruleset was applied to the system.\n",
      "For network_based monitoring a Moloch full packet capture system was also place on the network to log inbound and outbound traffic from the web application server.\n",
      "Without full network packet capture, malware investigation is difficult if not impossible (Vacca, 2014).\n",
      "A Snort network intrusion detection system was also configured to monitor the system for attacks or successful exploitation of the system.\n",
      "3.\n",
      "Malware Examples and Analysis The following samples were gathered between 2014 and 2015.\n",
      "A total of 49 unique specimens were gathered.\n",
      "The entire sample set was de_duplicated by comparing MD5 hash sums.\n",
      "3 representative samples: “China.Z_qheh”, Zollard, and “WSO Web Shell” were analyzed.\n",

      "Host_based antivirus software detection was marginal: ranging from 22% to 46% detection rate of the sample set.\n",

      "All three specimens analyzed and the entire sample set were detected using the ModSecurity web application firewall.\n",
      "Without monitoring of the web application layer, detecting and logging complete malware exploitation attempts would not be possible.\n",
