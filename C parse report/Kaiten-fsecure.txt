Summary
Backdoor:OSX/Tsunami.A is a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) flooder that is also capable of downloading files and executing shell commands in an infected system.
~~
Technical Details
Backdoor:OSX/Tsunami.A is an OS X platform ported version of the IRC bot for Linux called "Kaiten wa goraku." Upon execution, it connects to an IRC server and then joins a password protected channel where it waits for further commands.

It is mainly a distributed denial-of-service (DDos) flooder, hence the name Tsunami. However, it is also capable of performing other actions such as downloading additional files and executing shell commands in an infected system. These actions could grant the bot master almost a full control of the infected system.

The IRC parameters, drop files and launch points differ between variants. As of this writing, two variants have been found. The table below describes the characteristics of the two variants.

As of this writing, both servers are not accessible
