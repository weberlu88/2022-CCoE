Sentence 1,"In this malware attack activity, the initial method involves the execution of a function called get_executable_name, which reads the symlink /proc/self/exe using the readlink(..) function."
Sentence 2,"The backdoor then proceeds to gather various data, including CPU information, memory statistics, and the IP address of the infected machine."
Sentence 3,"It retrieves information from files located in the /proc directory, such as /proc/stat, /proc/meminfo, /proc/cpuinfo, /proc/net/dev, /proc/self/exe, /proc/self/maps, /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory, /proc/sys/kernel/rtsig-max, /proc/sys/kernel/ngroups_max, /proc/sys/kernel/osrelease, /proc/self/fd/%d/%s, /proc/self/fd, and /proc/net."
Sentence 4,"To ensure persistence, the malware modifies the /etc/rc.local and /etc/init.d/boot.local files."
Sentence 5,"Several string operations, such as using the sed command, are employed to modify these files."
Sentence 6,"Additionally, the backdoor opens specific files, including /etc/host.conf, /etc/resolv.conf, /etc/nsswitch.conf, /etc/suid-debug, and /etc/ld.so.cache."
Sentence 7,The backdoor establishes communication with its command and control (C2) server to receive instructions.
Sentence 8,"The malware establishes a connection to the IP address 23.224.59.34 on port 48080, enabling the attacker to send and receive remote shell commands."
Sentence 9,The network adapter information is obtained by reading the /proc/net/dev file.
Sentence 10,"This malware employs tactics such as data collection, command and control communication, persistence through file modification, and remote shell interaction to carry out its malicious activities."
