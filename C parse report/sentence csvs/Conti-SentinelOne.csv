Sentence 1,"CRIMEWARE
Hypervisor Ransomware | Multiple Threat Actor Groups Hop on Leaked Babuk Code to Build ESXi Lockers
 ALEX DELAMOTTE /  MAY 11, 2023
"
Sentence 2,"
Executive Summary
SentinelLabs identified 10 ransomware families using VMware ESXi lockers based on the 2021 Babuk source code leaks."
Sentence 3,"These variants emerged through H2 2022 and H1 2023, which shows an increasing trend of Babuk source code adoption."
Sentence 4,Leaked source code enables actors to target Linux systems when they may otherwise lack expertise to build a working program.
Sentence 5,"Source code leaks further complicate attribution, as more actors will adopt the tools."
Sentence 6,"Background
Throughout early 2023, SentinelLabs observed an increase in VMware ESXi ransomware based on Babuk (aka Babak, Babyk)."
Sentence 7,The Babuk leaks in September 2021 provided unprecedented insight into the development operations of an organized ransomware group.
Sentence 8,"Due to the prevalence of ESXi in on-prem and hybrid enterprise networks, these hypervisors are valuable targets for ransomware."
Sentence 9,"Over the past two years, organized ransomware groups adopted Linux lockers, including ALPHV, Black Basta, Conti, Lockbit, and REvil."
Sentence 10,"These groups focus on ESXi before other Linux variants, leveraging built-in tools for the ESXi hypervisor to kill guest machines, then encrypt crucial hypervisor files."
Sentence 11,"We identified overlap between the leaked Babuk source code and ESXi lockers attributed to Conti and REvil, with iterations of the latter sharply resembling one another."
Sentence 12,"We also compared them to the leaked Conti Windows locker source code, finding shared, bespoke function names and features."
Sentence 13,"In addition to these notorious groups, we also found smaller ransomware operations using the Babuk source code to generate more recognizable ESXi lockers."
Sentence 14,Ransom House’s Mario and a previously undocumented ESXi version of Play Ransomware comprise a small handful of the growing Babuk-descended ESXi locker landscape.
Sentence 15,"
Babuk Background
Babuk was one of the early players in the ESXi ransomware space."
Sentence 16,"The group’s longevity was crippled in 2021 when a Babuk developer leaked the builder source code for Babuk’s C++-based Linux Executable & Linkable Format (ELF) ESXi, Golang-based Network Attached Storage (NAS), and C++-based Windows ransomware tooling."
Sentence 17,"Through early 2022, there were few indications that actors had adapted the leaked Babuk source code, aside from a short-lived ‘Babuk 2.0’ variant and the occasional new Windows ransomware du jour."
Sentence 18,"As cybercrime research is often laser-focused on Windows, Linux trends can develop under the radar."
Sentence 19,SentinelLabs identified Babuk-descended ransomware through the string Doesn’t encrypted files: %d\n in the source code’s /бабак/esxi/enc/main.cpp.
Sentence 20,"Unique strings in Babuk source code main.cpp
"
Sentence 21,"
The Babuk builder specifies a file name for the newly generated binary, e_esxi.out."
Sentence 22,"Several samples we identified share a similar naming convention:
Ransomware Family	File Name
Mario	emario.out
Play	e_esxi.out
Babuk 2023 aka XVGV	RansomWare-e_esxi-XVGV2.out
"
Sentence 23,"
For encryption, ESXi Babuk uses an implementation of the Sosemanuk stream cipher to encrypt targeted files, in contrast with Babuk for Windows, which uses the HC-128 cipher."
Sentence 24,Both ESXi and Windows Babuk use Curve25519-Donna to generate the encryption key.
Sentence 25,"
Generations of Babuk
Comparison Methodology
SentinelLabs compiled an unstripped Babuk binary to establish a baseline of how Babuk looks and behaves, referred to henceforth as ‘Baseline Babuk.’ To understand whether the variants we identified are related to Babuk, we compared each variant to this Baseline Babuk sample and highlighted notable similarities and differences."
Sentence 26,"Babuk 2023 (.XVGV)
SHA1: e8bb26f62983055cfb602aa39a89998e8f512466
XVGV, aka Babuk 2023, emerged in March 2023 on Bleeping Computer’s forum as highlighted by @malwrhunterteam."
Sentence 27,"Baseline Babuk and XVGV share code derived from main.cpp, argument processing functions from args.cpp, and encryption implementation."
Sentence 28,"Like Babuk, XVGV requires the operator to provide a directory to encrypt as an argument."
Sentence 29,"During dynamic analysis, we provided the test system’s user directory."
Sentence 30,"On the first run, the sample generated a ransom note, HowToRestore.txt, in all child directories."
Sentence 31,"However, only six files were encrypted, each with either .log or .gz file extensions."
Sentence 32,Looking at the file extension inclusions reveals why the damage was limited: XVGV targets VMware-centric files and excludes those which do not match a designated list.
Sentence 33,"This is a behavior shared with Baseline Babuk, though the XVGV author added more file extensions."
Sentence 34,"XVGV .rodata segment references to file extensions (left) and Babuk source code equivalent
Play (.FinDom)
SHA1: dc8b9bc46f1d23779d3835f2b3648c21f4cf6151
This file references the file extension .FinDom, as well as the ransom email address [email protected], which are artifacts associated with Play Ransomware."
Sentence 35,"This is the first known version of Play built for a Linux system, which aligns this actor with the trend of ransomware groups increasingly targeting Linux."
Sentence 36,Play contains the same file searching functionality as Baseline Babuk; it also implements encryption using Sosemanuk.
Sentence 37,"Baseline Babuk (left) and Play disassembly of a ransom note construction function
The Play binary was submitted to VirusTotal as part of an archive (SHA1: 9290478cda302b9535702af3a1dada25818ad9ce) containing various hack tools and utilities–including AnyDesk, NetCat, a privilege escalation batch file, and encoded PowerShell Empire scripts–which are associated with ransomware group techniques after achieving initial access."
Sentence 38,"Mario (.emario)
SHA1: 048b3942c715c6bff15c94cdc0bb4414dbab9e07
Mario ransomware is operated by Ransom House, a group that emerged in 2021."
Sentence 39,Ransom House initially claimed that they target vulnerable networks to steal data without encrypting files.
Sentence 40,"However, the group has since adopted cryptographic lockers."
Sentence 41,"The samples share a very similar find_files_recursive function, including the default ransom note filename How To Restore Your Files.txt."
Sentence 42,The encryption functions are also the same.
Sentence 43,The verbose ransom note content is the most unique part of Mario’s ESXi locker.
Sentence 44,The Ransom House actors provide very explicit instructions to the victim explaining what to do and how to contact the actors.
Sentence 45,"Mario strings show default Babuk logging messages and the ransom note
"
Sentence 46,"
Conti POC (.conti)
Conti POC – SHA1: 091f4bddea8bf443bc8703730f15b21f7ccf00e9
Conti ESXi Locker – SHA1: ee827023780964574f28c6ba333d800b73eae5c4
"
Sentence 47,"
To our surprise, the Babuk hunt identified several binaries internally called ‘Conti POC,’ likely short for ‘proof of concept,’ which were documented in a September 2022 campaign against entities in Mexico."
Sentence 48,Conti was a notoriously well-organized and ruthless ransomware group.
Sentence 49,Leaks revealed Conti’s organizational structure resembles many legitimate companies more than a criminal enterprise: the operation employed middle management and a human resources department.
Sentence 50,Chat history leaks circa early 2021 revealed that Conti had trouble getting their ESXi locker to work.
Sentence 51,We compared several iterations of Conti and Babuk to assess a connection.
Sentence 52,"Conti ESXi emerged in April 2022, which could mean that Conti implemented Babuk code after it was leaked in September 2021 and ultimately got the locker to work."
Sentence 53,"Conti POC & Conti ESXi Locker: The Conti POC is less mature, which aligns with being a ‘proof of concept.’ Conti POC and Conti ESXi share many function names and behaviors, including the same argument processing functions and conditions."
Sentence 54,"We conclude these samples are related, and that Conti POC is a likely predecessor to Conti’s ESXi locker."
Sentence 55,"find_files_recursive in Baseline Babuk (left) and SearchFiles in Conti POC
"
Sentence 56,"
Comparing to Conti Leaked Windows Code: There are considerable overlaps in utility as well as function names between both Linux versions of Conti (POC and ESXi) and the leaked Windows Conti code."
Sentence 57,Both versions use the same open-source ChaCha encryption implementation.
Sentence 58,"The leaked Conti Windows code contains commented-out references to HandleCommandLine, a function seen in the other Conti variants we analyzed, and several shared arguments to parse, such as prockiller."
Sentence 59,It is possible that a developer aligned function names between the Windows version and the ESXi locker in aspiration of feature parity.
Sentence 60,"

Sentence 61,"
REvil aka Revix (.rhkrc)
RHKRC – SHA1: 74e4b2f7abf9dbd376372c9b05b26b02c2872e4b
Revix June 2021 – SHA1: 29f16c046a344e0d0adfea80d5d7958d6b6b8cfa
We identified a Babuk-like sample internally called RHKRC, which appends the .rhkrc extension to filenames, a behavior associated with the REvil group’s “Revix” ESXi locker."
Sentence 62,"Interestingly, reports of Revix in-the-wild date back to June 2021, which predates the September 2021 Babuk source code leaks."
Sentence 63,"To understand where this fits in the development timeline, we compared several iterations of related activity:
RHKRC & Conti POC: Surprisingly similar, these versions both implement encryption identically through ChaCha20 as outlined above."
Sentence 64,"They share a nearly identical, otherwise unique InitializeEncryptor function."
Sentence 65,These samples are related.
Sentence 66,"InitializeEncryptor functions from RHKRC (left) and Conti POC
InitializeEncryptor functions from RHKRC (left) and Conti POC
EncryptFull functions from RHKRC (left) and Conti POC
EncryptFull functions from RHKRC (left) and Conti POC
RHKRC & Baseline Babuk: These samples share many function names, including Babuk’s native thread pooling."
Sentence 67,"However, RHKRC implements encryption differently, and it has more bespoke ESXi CLI activity."
Sentence 68,"We assess that these samples are related, though RHKRC is more mature despite also being in the ‘proof of concept’ stage."
Sentence 69,RHKRC & June 2021 Revix: We compared RHKRC with Revix from June 2021 in-the-wild activity.
Sentence 70,Revix is much more mature and contains dynamic code deobfuscation measures unseen in other variants analyzed.
Sentence 71,"RHKRC and Revix share the same internal filename (elf.exe), ransom note name, and appended file extension."
Sentence 72,"However, these similarities are mainly cosmetic, and we are unable to conclude if a definitive connection exists."
Sentence 73,Any theories about these coincidences amounts to conjecture.
Sentence 74,"Honorable Mention
SentinelLabs notes there are several other known families descended from the Babuk ESXi source code, including:
Cylance ransomware (unrelated to the security company of the same name)
Dataf Locker
Rorschach aka BabLock
Lock4
RTM Locker (per Uptycs)
While there are undoubtedly more Babuk offspring that slipped under the radar, there are other unique ESXi ransomware families."
Sentence 75,"A cursory glance at ALPHV, BlackBasta, Hive, and Lockbit’s ESXi lockers shows no obvious similarity to Babuk."
Sentence 76,"Babuk is occasionally blamed in error, too."
Sentence 77,Reports on the February ESXiArgs campaign–which briefly devastated some unpatched cloud services–claim the eponymous locker is derived from Babuk.
Sentence 78,"However, our analysis found little similarity between ESXiArgs (SHA1: f25846f8cda8b0460e1db02ba6d3836ad3721f62) and Babuk."
Sentence 79,The only noteworthy similarity is the use of the same open-source Sosemanuk encryption implementation.
Sentence 80,"The main function is entirely different, as shown below."
Sentence 81,"ESXiArgs also uses an external shell script to search files and provide arguments to the esxcli, so there is native no find_files_recursive function to compare."
Sentence 82,"ESXiArgs main function
ESXiArgs main function
Conclusion
SentinelLabs’ analysis identified unexpected connections between ESXi ransomware families, exposing likely relationships between Babuk and more illustrious operations like Conti and REvil."
Sentence 83,"While ties to REvil remain tentative, the possibility exists that these groups–Babuk, Conti, and REvil–potentially outsourced an ESXi locker project to the same developer."
Sentence 84,"The talent pool for Linux malware developers is surely much smaller in ransomware development circles, which have historically held demonstrable expertise in crafting elegant Windows malware."
Sentence 85,"Ransomware groups have experienced numerous leaks, so it is plausible smaller leaks occurred within these circles."
Sentence 86,"Additionally, actors may share code to collaborate, similar to open-sourcing a development project."
Sentence 87,There is a noticeable trend that actors increasingly use the Babuk builder to develop ESXi and Linux ransomware.
Sentence 88,"This is particularly evident when used by actors with fewer resources, as these actors are less likely to significantly modify the Babuk source code."
Sentence 89,"Based on the popularity of Babuk’s ESXi locker code, actors may also turn to the group’s Go-based NAS locker."
Sentence 90,"Golang remains a niche choice for many actors, but it continues to increase in popularity."
Sentence 91,The targeted NAS systems are also based on Linux.
Sentence 92,"While the NAS locker is less complex, the code is clear and legible, which could make ransomware more accessible for developers who are familiar with Go or similar programming languages."
