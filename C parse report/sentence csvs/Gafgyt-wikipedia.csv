Sentence 1,"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

BASHLITE (also known as Gafgyt, Lizkebab, PinkSlip, Qbot, Torlus and LizardStresser) is malware which infects Linux systems in order to launch distributed denial-of-service attacks (DDoS)."
Sentence 2,"[1] Originally it was also known under the name Bashdoor,[2] but this term now refers to the exploit method used by the malware."
Sentence 3,It has been used to launch attacks of up to 400 Gbps.
Sentence 4,"[3]

The original version in 2014 exploited a flaw in the bash shell - the Shellshock software bug - to exploit devices running BusyBox."
Sentence 5,[4][5][6][7] A few months later a variant was detected that could also infect other vulnerable devices in the local network.
Sentence 6,"[8] In 2015 its source code was leaked, causing a proliferation of different variants,[9] and by 2016 it was reported that one million devices have been infected."
Sentence 7,"[10][11][12][13]

Of the identifiable devices participating in these botnets in August 2016 almost 96 percent were IoT devices (of which 95 percent were cameras and DVRs), roughly 4 percent were home routers - and less than 1 percent were compromised Linux servers."

Sentence 9,"
Design
BASHLITE is written in C, and designed to easily cross-compile to various computer architectures."
Sentence 10,"[9]

Exact capabilities differ between variants, but the most common features[9] generate several different types of DDoS attacks: it can hold open TCP connections, send a random string of junk characters to a TCP or a UDP port, or repeatedly send TCP packets with specified flags."
Sentence 11,They may also have a mechanism to run arbitrary shell commands on the infected machine.
Sentence 12,There are no facilities for reflected or amplification attacks.
Sentence 13,BASHLITE uses a client–server model for command and control.
Sentence 14,The protocol used for communication is essentially a lightweight version of Internet Relay Chat (IRC).
Sentence 15,"[14] Even though it supports multiple command and control servers, most variants only have a single command and control IP-address hardcoded."
Sentence 16,"It propagates via brute forcing, using a built-in dictionary of common usernames and passwords."
Sentence 17,"The malware connects to random IP addresses and attempts to login, with successful logins reported back to the command and control server."
