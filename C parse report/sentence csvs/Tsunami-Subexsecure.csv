tsunami is a powerful malware that is used for ddos flooding in unix/linux systems."
"""Sentence 2","it makes
the infected machine a bot which is then used for ddos attacks."
"""Sentence 3","the malware sample that we
got is a new variant of tsunami malware."
"""Sentence 4","this malware is controlled by an irc server, which
establishes a secure connection with the victim machine and enables a backdoor that collects
the sensitive information from the system and turns the infected system into a bot."
"""Sentence 5","overview
the sample is analysed from the memory."
"""Sentence 6","a suspicious process was detected in the memory
which communicated with a malicious ip."
"""Sentence 7",that ip is an irc server or channel.
"""Sentence 8","the infected
system then listens and interprets commands from the channel."
"""Sentence 9","the malware behaves like a
backdoor and information stealer, it executes shell commands and opens system files to get the
system information, and then sends the information to the server."
"""Sentence 10","infection flow
technical analysis
after the malware was executed in the debian 32-bit system, we dumped the memory."
"""Sentence 11","the
acquired ram was analysed by volatility."
"""Sentence 12","backdoor:
we checked the processes that were running in the memory using “pslist” plugin as shown in
the figure below:
figure 1 pslist plugin
we found a suspicious process with a very strange name."
"""Sentence 13","this process was the last process that
was running on the system."
"""Sentence 14","as shown in the figure above, the process with the name “xpqjcock” has a pid “2498”."
"""Sentence 15","we
checked the environment variables of the process and the process was running in the root
directory (as shown in the figure below)."
"""Sentence 16","network communication:
figure 2 process list
figure 3 environment variable
figure 4 network record
we extracted the network activities from the memory."
"""Sentence 17","as shown in the figure 4, we see that a
suspicious process is making a connection with an external ip on port 8080 i.e., https."
"""Sentence 18","we
analysed and found that the ip is malicious and it is an irc server."
"""Sentence 19","the ip has a history of
communication with tsunami backdoors."
"""Sentence 20","the ip has a passive record of the following domains:
derpcity.ru
uranus.kei.su
these are malicious domains and used in the irc channels."
"""Sentence 21",we used yara scan plugin to scan for strings in the process.
"""Sentence 22","we searched for http in the process
as shown in the figure below:
we found that the server is sending a get request to the client and some data has been sent to
the irc server, as shown in the figure below."
"""Sentence 23","information stealer:
we got the command line arguments that were made by the suspected process using “psaux”."
"""Sentence 24","figure 5 yarascan
figure 6 request from server
figure 7 psaux plugin
the process collects the network configuration and ip address information by executing the
“ifconfig” command, as shown in the figure below."
"""Sentence 25",we checked for open handles of the suspected process using “lsof”.
"""Sentence 26","the process opened the files as shown in the figure below:
it identifies the systems linux kernel version, operating system name, and system hardware
and sends all the information to the irc channel."
"""Sentence 27","figure 8 command executed by the process

bot:
then the channel sends command to all the bots to perform attacks on the system."
"""Sentence 28","the
command is sent in a specific format, like
<target>.<port>.<time>.<threads>..===>.fast.tcp.connect().flooder
in this, it specifies the target, port, time, threads and does tcp flooding."
