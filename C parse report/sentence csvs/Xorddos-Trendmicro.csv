summary
xor ddos is a linux trojan malware with rootkit capabilities that was used to launch large-scale ddos attacks."
Sentence 2,its name stems from the heavy usage of xor encryption in both malware and network communication to the c&cs.
Sentence 3,"it is built for multiple linux architectures like arm, x86 and x64."
Sentence 4,"in 2014, a whitehat security research group detected a one-liner shell script being injected via ssh connection."
Sentence 5,the hack scheme is to spread a new ddos mechanism using elf to infect linux based computers.
Sentence 6,a third party av company concluded that the installation is customized to the victim's linux environment for the sake of running an additional rootkit component.
Sentence 7,"this malware performs c&c communication in both directions using a hard-coded xor key, hence its name xor ddos."
Sentence 8,"capabilities:

system changes
drops copies of itself to multiple directories
auto-start mechanisms
payload
information theft
backdoor commands
downloads files
propagation
rootkit capability
"
Sentence 9,"
impact:

launches dos/ddos attacks
malware routine can be found on the following virus reports:

threat encyclopedia: elf_xorddos.sm
threat encyclopedia: trojan.linux.xorddos.smsh

"
Sentence 11,"
identification:

the malware is usually found on linux based servers."
Sentence 12,"since the malware has a capability to hide itself using its rootkit capabilities and xor encrypted c&c communication, un-monitored and un-protected servers may not report the infection unless an administrator is able to see the unusual processes running or unusual connections to un-familiar ip addresses."
Sentence 13,"the threat investigator should look for the following visible indicators:

auto-start mechanisms
dropped copies of the malware
unusual network connections to unknown ip addresses
running processes usually showing as 8-10 random characters
"
Sentence 14,"
installation:

actions to take:

trend micro deep security for linux should be able to detect and clean this malware."
Sentence 15,"there are times that the ds agent doesn’t have permission to the locked file, so make sure that there’s no running process or service of xorddos (random characters), to fully clean this infection."
Sentence 16,"integrity monitoring detection

unix - open port monitor (this rule monitors and logs for ports created and deleted in a unix environment.)"
Sentence 17,"for machines that have recurring detection, you can use attk for linux and submit the logs to us for further analysis."

overview
infection channel: dropped by other malware, downloaded from the internet
this backdoor arrives on a system as a file dropped by other malware or as a file downloaded unknowingly by users when visiting malicious sites."
Sentence 19,"it executes commands from a remote malicious user, effectively compromising the affected system."
Sentence 20,"technical details
file size: 625,611 bytes
file type: elf
memory resident: yes
initial samples received date: 21 nov 2016
payload: compromises system security, steals information
arrival details

this backdoor arrives on a system as a file dropped by other malware or as a file downloaded unknowingly by users when visiting malicious sites."
Sentence 21,"installation

this backdoor drops the following files:

/usr/bin/{random 10 characters}
/bin/{random 10 characters}
/tmp/{random 10 characters}
it drops the following copies of itself into the affected system:

/lib/libudev.so
autostart technique
"
Sentence 22,"
this backdoor drops the following files:

/etc/cron.hourly/gcc.sh (cron is a time-based job scheduler in unix-like computer operating systems)
backdoor routine
"
Sentence 23,"
this backdoor executes the following commands from a remote malicious user:

execute files
download files
update malware
delete files
terminate process
remove services
remove self
perform ddos attack
it posts the following information to its command and control (c&c) server:

http://www1."
Sentence 24,"{blocked}t456.com/dd.rar:1520
"
Sentence 25,"
information theft

this backdoor gathers the following data:

memory information
cpu information
network speed
pid of running process
md5 of running process
other details
"
Sentence 26,"
this backdoor does the following:

drops a shell script in /etc/init.d folder which setups the auto-start mechanism of the malware."
Sentence 27,"creates symbolic links which points to the script in /etc/init.d:
/etc/rc{1-5}.d/s90{random numbers}
/etc/rc.d/rc{1-5}.d/s90{random numbers}
get the magic string value from the file /var/run/gcc.pid
read the following from its configuration file:
md5 - checksum of file
denyip - open communication with an ip
filename - list of filename
rmfile - files to remove"
