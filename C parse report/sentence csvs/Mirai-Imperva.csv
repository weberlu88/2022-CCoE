by now many of you have heard that on september 20, 2016, the website of renowned security journalist brian krebs was hit with one of the largest distributed denial of service attacks (ddos) to date."
"""Sentence 2","the magnitude of that attack, the star status of its target within the infosec community and the heaps of drama that followed made this one of the most high-profile ddos stories of the year."
"""Sentence 3","on september 30, the story saw another development when a hackforum user by the name of ‘anna-senpai’ leaked the source code for mirai—the botnet malware behind the attacks."
"""Sentence 4","it was speculated that in doing so the perpetrator was trying to hide his tracks, rightfully concerned about the repercussions of taking a swing at brian."
"""Sentence 5","since the source code was published, the imperva incapsula security team has been digging deep to see what surprises mirai may hold."
"""Sentence 6","in this post we’ll share:

our own encounters with mirai botnets
the results of our investigation of mirai’s source code
update:

new mirai scanner released: we developed a scanner that can check whether one or more devices on your network is infected by or vulnerable to mirai."
"""Sentence 7",you can find the beta of the mirai scanner here.
"""Sentence 8",if you missed out “deep dive into the mirai botnet” hosted by ben herzberg check out our video recording of the event.
"""Sentence 9","close encounters of the third kind
a thorough review of mirai’s source code allowed us to create a strong signature with which we could identify mirai’s activity on our network."
"""Sentence 10",we then turned to our logs and examined recent assaults to see if any of them carried mirai’s fingerprints.
"""Sentence 11","sure enough, we found the mirai botnet was responsible for a slew of gre floods that were mitigated by our service on august 17. using a hit-and-run tactic, the attack peaked at 280 gbps and 130 mpps, both indicating a very powerful botnet."
"""Sentence 12","mirai-powered gre floods

figure 1: mitigating a slew of mirai-powered gre floods, peaking at 280 gbps/130 mpps
investigation of the attack uncovered 49,657 unique ips which hosted mirai-infected devices."
"""Sentence 13","as previously reported, these were mostly cctv cameras—a popular choice of ddos botnet herders."
"""Sentence 14",other victimized devices included dvrs and routers.
"""Sentence 15","overall, ip addresses of mirai-infected devices were spotted in 164 countries."
"""Sentence 16","as evidenced by the map below, the botnet ips are highly dispersed, appearing even in such remote locations as montenegro, tajikistan and somalia."
"""Sentence 17","geo-locations of all mirai-infected devices

interestingly, since the source code was made public, we’ve also seen a few new mirai-powered assaults."
"""Sentence 18","this time they took the form of low-volume application layer http floods, one of which was even directed against our domain (www.incapsula.com)."
"""Sentence 19","characterized by relative low requests per second (rps) counts and small numbers of source ips, these looked like the experimental first steps of new mirai users who were testing the water after the malware became widely available."
"""Sentence 20","likely, these are signs of things to come and we expect to deal with mirai-powered attacks in the near future."
"""Sentence 21","mirai botnet http flood

mirai is a piece of malware that infects iot devices and is used as a launch platform for ddos attacks."
"""Sentence 22","mirai’s c&c (command and control) code is coded in go, while its bots are coded in c.

like most malware in this category, mirai is built for two core purposes:

locate and compromise iot devices to further grow the botnet."
"""Sentence 23",launch ddos attacks based on instructions received from a remote c&c.
"""Sentence 24","to fulfill its recruitment function, mirai performs wide-ranging scans of ip addresses."
"""Sentence 25","the purpose of these scans is to locate under-secured iot devices that could be remotely accessed via easily guessable login credentials—usually factory default usernames and passwords (e.g., admin/admin)."
"""Sentence 26",mirai uses a brute force technique for guessing passwords a.k.a.

for network layer assaults, mirai is capable of launching gre ip and gre eth floods, as well as syn and ack floods, stomp (simple text oriented message protocol) floods, dns floods and udp flood attacks."
"""Sentence 30","mira also seems to possess some bypass capabilities, which allow it to circumvent security solutions:

#define table_atk_dosarrest                     45  // server: dosarrest

while this may seem like a standard source code, mirai also has a few quirks that we found especially intriguing…

mirai’s “don’t mess with” list
one of the most interesting things revealed by the code was a hardcoded list of ips mirai bots are programmed to avoid when performing their ip scans."

"""Sentence 38",that is unless some ip ranges were cleared off the code before it was released.
"""Sentence 39","a territorial predator
another interesting thing about mirai is its “territorial” nature."
"""Sentence 40","the malware holds several killer scripts meant to eradicate other worms and trojans, as well as prohibiting remote connection attempts of the hijacked device."

killer_kill_by_port(htons(23))  // kill telnet service
killer_kill_by_port(htons(22))  // kill ssh service
killer_kill_by_port(htons(80))  // kill http service

"""Sentence 47","lastly, it’s worth noting that mirai code holds traces of russian-language strings despite its english c&c interface."
