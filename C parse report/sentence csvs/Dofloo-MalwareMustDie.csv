"""Sentence 10","why i know it is aiming for router is because, the way to use internet to connect directly to remote global ip, the method used to grab data using specific location in the embedded device, and the trace of sources used during the compilation of the malware itself."

as usual, china actor(s) serves their malware binary under specific panel, and this binary is spotted among with other linux/elknots malware."
