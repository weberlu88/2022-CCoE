Sentence 1,"Linux Gafgyt.B!tr Exploits Netcore Vulnerability

By Amir Zali | January 20, 2017
Over the past few months we have seen a lot of malware activity around the Netcore vulnerability, so we decided to take closer look at its exploitation."
Sentence 2,The following screen shot shows attack traffic captured through Wireshark.
Sentence 3,"Figure 1

Figure 2 shows a quick enumeration of the sample."
Sentence 4,(There are different versions of the sample for several architectures.
Sentence 5,"We chose to analyze the MIPS one)

Figure 2

My analysis shows that this sample is a variant of the Gafgyt family, with some changes which I will discuss in detail later in this blog."
Sentence 6,After the Gafgyt bot executes it establishes a connection to IP address 8.8.8.8 on port 53 in order to track the internet activity of its targeted victim.
Sentence 7,"Upon successfully connecting, the bot continues to gather information about the current device IP address, attaches it to a string that is the build name of the infector, and sends it to the C&C server IP address that has been hardcoded into the infector file."
Sentence 8,"(Figure 3)

Figure 3

The main process of the bot serves as a listener that waits for commands from its C&C."
Sentence 9,"If no command is received it sends a “PING” message to the server, which means there are regular communication messages sent between the bot and the C&C server."
Sentence 10,"
The following commands trigger certain functionality on the bot:

PING/PONG/DUP: PING and PONG are monitoring commands to test if the server and bot are alive."
Sentence 11,"DUP will kill the bot.
!"
Sentence 12,":
SH : Linux command execution module
PYTHON : Spreader/Scanner module based on python
TABLE: File Descriptor enumerator for the victim
UPDATE: Downloader for the latest version of the bot
SCANNER : Spreader/Scanner module
REMOVER: Found and kill known bots on the victim
GETPUBLICIP: Enumerate victim public IP
UDP : UDP flooding attack
TCP : TCP flooding attack
HTTP : HTTP flooding attack
CNC : connect to specified CNC server periodically
STD : Another UDP flooding
KILLATTK: Kill the bot processes
LOLNOGTFO: Exit the process
Some other samples use “!"
Sentence 13,*” format instead of “!”.
Sentence 14,Now let’s have a look at some of these commands and their associated modules.
Sentence 15,"
Scanner Modules
The Gafgyt bot has two scanners."
Sentence 16,Either of them is triggered upon receiving a “!
Sentence 17,SCANNER ON/OFF” and “!
Sentence 18,PYTHON START/OFF” command.
Sentence 19,We’ll start by taking a look at the first scanner (Figure 4.)
Sentence 20,"
Once it is activated (Figure 5) the bot forks a process and sends a confirmation message to the C&C server."
Sentence 21,It then generates IPs from the following subnets and tests them one by one until a “!
Sentence 22,"SCANNER OFF” command is received:
49.144.X.X , 49.145.X.X , 49.146.X.X , 49.147.X.X , 49.148.X.X , 58.69.X.X, 58.71.X.X

For each randomly generated IP received, the bot connects to port 23 (telnet) and tries to login using a simple username/password dictionary (Figure 6.)"
Sentence 23,"For any successful login the bot infects the victim by sending shell commands, and then informs the server about the infection."
Sentence 24,"(Figure 7)

The second module is a Python SCANNER."
Sentence 25,This module is activated when the malware receives a “!
Sentence 26,PYTHON START” command.
Sentence 27,"(Figure 8)

Most of the C&C servers had deleted the python scanner."
Sentence 28,"However, after some hunting we managed to find the python script."
Sentence 29,The python script is run by passing the command “python good2.py 1000 LUCKY 1 3” to the “execve” system call.
Sentence 30,"The first argument indicates the number of running threads for the script, and the second indicates the IP ranges to scan, which are:

122.3.0.0/16, 122.52.0.0/15, 122.54.0.0/16, 124.83.0.0/16, 124.105.0.0/16, 124.106.0.0/15, 112.200.0.0/13, 112.208.0.0/14, 112.212.0.0/15,112.214.0.0/16,210.213.0.0/16

The third argument is used to specify an IP instead of the string “LUCKY.” It indicates the end of the range to scan, and the last parameter is an index to a list of strings in “user:password.” {(admin, 1234) (root,root) (guest,guest) (telnet,telnet)} are used to log in to the SSH service."
Sentence 31,"If the login is successful, the victim’s address along with the username and password will be written into a file and the victim will then be infected."
Sentence 32,The script uses the Paramiko package to do the process.
Sentence 33,Enough said about the scanners.
Sentence 34,The main intention of this bot is to launch a DDoS attack.
Sentence 35,"So we briefly describe the use of STD flooder as an example, below."
Sentence 36,"
STD flooding modules:
Based on our analysis, this module accepts three arguments, “!"
Sentence 37,"STD , and ”."
Sentence 38,"Once the bot receives the command to launch the attack, it starts to send UDP packets with a bit length of 65 to the victim’s “Address/Port” for given period of time."
Sentence 39,"(Figure 9)

"
Sentence 40,"
Conclusion
The era of IOT has started, so we are certain to see more of these sorts of attacks in the near future."
Sentence 41,"The primary reasons that this sort of malware is interesting for cybercriminals are their level of security, the lack of knowledge of the end users, and usually, the lack of security mechanisms built into the devices themselves."
Sentence 42,"
Fortinet’s products are equipped with 3 signatures to protect customers:

“Gafgyt.Botnet”
“Netcore.Netis.Devices.Hardcoded.Password.Security.Bypass”
“Linux/Gafgyt.B!tr”
