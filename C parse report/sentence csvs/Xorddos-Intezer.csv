Sentence 1,"new linux backdoor redxor likely operated by chinese nation-state actor
written by joakim kennedy and avigayil mechtinger - 10 march 2021

we discovered a new sophisticated backdoor targeting linux endpoints and servers
based on tactics, techniques, and procedures (ttps) the backdoor is believed to be developed by chinese nation-state actors
the backdoor masquerades itself as polkit daemon."
Sentence 2,we named it redxor for its network data encoding scheme based on xor.
Sentence 3,"the malware was compiled on red hat enterprise linux
we provide recommendations for detecting and responding to this threat below
monitor your cloud environments for redxor and other linux malware."
Sentence 4,protect 10 servers for free with the intezer protect community edition.
Sentence 5,"intro
2020 set a record for new linux malware families."
Sentence 6,new malware families targeting linux systems are being discovered on a regular basis.
Sentence 7,backdoors attributed to advanced threat actors are disclosed less frequently.
Sentence 8,"we have discovered an undocumented backdoor targeting linux systems, masqueraded as polkit daemon."
Sentence 9,we named it redxor for its network data encoding scheme based on xor.
Sentence 10,"based on victimology, as well as similar components and tactics, techniques, and procedures (ttps), we believe redxor was developed by high profile chinese threat actors."
Sentence 11,"the samples, which have low detection rates in virustotal, were uploaded from indonesia and taiwan, countries known to be targeted by chinese threat actors."
Sentence 12,"the samples are compiled with a legacy gcc compiler on an old release of red hat enterprise linux, hinting that redxor is used in targeted attacks against legacy linux systems."
Sentence 13,during our investigation we experienced an “on and off” availability of the command and control (c2) server indicating that the operation is still active.
Sentence 14,"connections to chinese threat actors
we uncovered key similarities between redxor and previously reported malware associated with winnti umbrella threat group."
Sentence 15,"these malware are pwnlnx backdoor and xor.ddos and groundhog, two botnets attributed to winnti by blackberry."
Sentence 16,"the below samples can be used for reference:
pwnlnx –  4278ab79c34ea92788259fb43e535aa3
xor.ddos – d6a6dee6afa6879b729a0af3cde7ff33
"
Sentence 17,"
similarities between the samples:
use of old open-source kernel rootkits: redxor uses an open-source lkm rootkit called “adore-ng” to hide its process."
Sentence 18,based on a fireeye report winnti used this rootkit in their “adore.xse” linux backdoor.
Sentence 19,embedding open-source lkm rootkits is a common winnti technique.
Sentence 20,the group has been documented using azazel and suterusu.
Sentence 21,the checklkm function name used by redxor has also been used in pwnlnx and xor.ddos.
Sentence 22,provides the operator with a pseudo-terminal: redxor uses python pty shell by importing the python pty library.
Sentence 23,"pwnlnx implements the pty shell function in c.
 figure 1: python pty shell used in redxor
"
Sentence 24,"
encoding network with xor: the backdoor encodes its network data with a scheme based on xor."
Sentence 25,encoding network data with xor has been used in previous winnti malware including pwnlnx.
Sentence 26,"persistence service name: as part of its persistence methods, redxor attempts to create a service under rc.d."
Sentence 27,the developer added “s99” before the name of the service to lower its priority and make it run last on system initiation.
Sentence 28,this technique was used in xor.ddos and groundhog samples where the malware developer added “s90” to the service name.
Sentence 29,main functions flow: pwnlx and redxor have a main function which is in charge of initialization.
Sentence 30,"in both backdoors, the main function calls another function which is in charge of the main logic."
Sentence 31,the main logic function names are main_process in redxor and mainthread in pwlnx.
Sentence 32,both main functions daemonize the process to detach from the terminal and run in the background.
Sentence 33,xml for file listing: redxor’s directory function and pwnlnx’s getfiles function are both in charge of directory listing.
Sentence 34,"their code flow implementation is different, however, as both malware send the directory listing as an xml file to the c2 server."
Sentence 35,figure 2 shows the xml structure used in pwnlnx and redxor.
Sentence 36,"the file’s data used in both functions are: path, name, type, user, permission, size, time."
Sentence 37,"figure 2: the xml structure used by pwnlnx’s getfiles function and redxor’s directory function
legacy red hat compilers: redxor and pwnlnx were both compiled with a red hat 4.4.7 compiler."
Sentence 38,this compiler is the default gcc compiler on rhel6.
Sentence 39,chown similarity: both pwnlnx and redxor change the file’s user and group owner to a large id.
Sentence 40,the same technique has been used by the xor.ddos malware as referenced in the analysis by malwaremustdie.
Sentence 41,"figure 3: similarity between pwnlnx and redxor of the uid and gid used with “lchown” function call
"
Sentence 42,"
overall flow and functionalities: the overall code flow, behavior, and capabilities of redxor are very similar to pwnlnx."
Sentence 43,both have file uploading and downloading functionalities together with a running shell.
Sentence 44,the network tunneling functionality in both families is called “portmap”.
Sentence 45,"unstripped elf binaries: malware developers will often tamper with a file’s symbols and/or sections, making it harder for researchers to analyze them."
Sentence 46,"however, redxor and various winnti malware, including pwnlnx and xor.ddos, are unstripped."
Sentence 47,"technical analysis
the samples are both unstripped 64-bit elf files called po1kitd-update-k. uploaded to virustotal from taiwan and indonesia, they are low detected at the time of this writing."
Sentence 48,"figure 4: 2bd6e2f8c1a97347b1e499e29a1d9b7c in virustotal
"
Sentence 49,"
malware installation
upon execution redxor forks off a child process allowing the parent process to exit."
Sentence 50,the purpose is to detach the process from the shell.
Sentence 51,the new child determines if it has been executed as the root user or as another user on the system.
Sentence 52,"it does this to create a hidden folder, called “.po1kitd.thumb”, inside the user’s home folder which is used to store files related to the malware."
Sentence 53,the malware creates a hidden file called “.po1kitd-2a4d53” inside the folder.
Sentence 54,"the file is locked to the current running process, seen in figure 5, essentially creating a mutex."
Sentence 55,"if another instance of the malware is executed, it also tries to obtain the lock but ultimately fails."
Sentence 56,upon this failure the process exits.
Sentence 57,"figure 5: the malware creates a “mutex” file locking it to the process id
"
Sentence 58,"
after the malware creates the mutex, it installs itself on the infected machine."
Sentence 59,"as shown in figure 6, the malware looks up its current path and moves the binary to the created folder."
Sentence 60,it hides the file by naming it “.po1kitd-update-k”.
Sentence 61,figure 6: malware moves the binary to the hidden folder “po1kitd.thumb” created earlier.
Sentence 62,it first tries to use the “rename” function provided by libc.
Sentence 63,"if this fails, it executes an “mv” shell command via the “system” function
"
Sentence 64,"
after installing the binary to the hidden folder, the malware sets up persistence via “init” scripts."
Sentence 65,"the following files are created after executing the malware on boot:
/usr/syno/etc/rc.d/s99po1kitd-update.sh
/etc/init.d/po1kitd-update
/etc/rc2.d/s99po1kitd-update
the malware checks if the rootkit is active by creating a file and removing it."
Sentence 66,"then, the malware compares the “saved set-user-id” of the process to the user id."
Sentence 67,"if they don’t match, the rootkit is enabled."
Sentence 68,"if they match, it looks to see if the user id is “10”."
Sentence 69,"if this is the case, the rootkit is enabled."
Sentence 70,"this logic is shown in figure 7.
figure 7: logic used by redxor to check if the rootkit is enabled
"
Sentence 71,"
the “checklkm” logic is almost identical to the “adore_init” function in the “adore-ng” rootkit."
Sentence 72,afore-ng is a chinese open-source lkm (loadable kernel module) rootkit.
Sentence 73,this technique allows the malware to stay under the radar by hiding its processes.
Sentence 74,"the code for the init function is shown in figure 8.
 figure 8: client authentication code for the adore-ng rootkit
"
Sentence 75,"
configuration
the malware stores the configuration encrypted within the binary."
Sentence 76,in addition to the command and control (c2) ip address and port it can also be configured to use a proxy.
Sentence 77,"the configuration includes a password, as can be seen in figure 9. this password is used by the malware to authenticate to the c2 server."
Sentence 78,"figure 9: configuration options for the malware
"
Sentence 79,"
the configuration values are decrypted by the “doxor” function."
Sentence 80,a pseudo-code representation of the function is shown in figure 10. the decryption logic is a simple xor against a byte key.
Sentence 81,the byte key is incremented by a constant for each item in the buffer.
Sentence 82,the only configuration value that is not encrypted is the server port.
Sentence 83,the port value is used to derive the key and the adder.
Sentence 84,the key is derived from bit shifting the port value eight steps to the right.
Sentence 85,the constant uses the port value.
Sentence 86,figure 10: decryption logic of the configuration data.
Sentence 87,"the data is xored against a key byte that is incremented by a constant for each entry in the buffer
communication with the c2
"
Sentence 88,"
the malware communicates with the c2 server over a tcp socket."
Sentence 89,the traffic is made to look like http traffic.
Sentence 90,figure 11 shows a pseudo-code representation of the function used by the malware to prepare data that is to be sent to the c2 server.
Sentence 91,"first, it fills the buffer with null bytes."
Sentence 92,the request body is xored against a key.
Sentence 93,the malware uses the buffer length as the key.
Sentence 94,this value is also passed into the function as the “total_length” argument.
Sentence 95,"figure 11: function for preparing data to be sent to the c2 server
the same logic is used to decrypt the response body from the c2 server."
Sentence 96,"from the response, the malware extracts “jsessionid”, “content-length”, “total-length” and the response body."
Sentence 97,"the data is added to a struct with the following layout:
0x0 jsessionid as int
"
Sentence 98,"

0x8 content-length as long

0x10 total-length as long

0x18 response body

the content length is the length of the response body but also used as the key."
Sentence 99,the total length value is used as a constant which is added to the key in each iteration.
Sentence 100,the jsessionid value holds the command id for the job the c2 wants the malware to perform.
Sentence 101,"commands
the c2 server tells the malware to execute different commands via a command code that is returned in the “jsessionid” cookie."
Sentence 102,the codes are encoded as decimal integers.
Sentence 103,a full list of commands supported by the analyzed malware sample are shown in the table below.
Sentence 104,they can be grouped into command types.
Sentence 105,"commands in the 2000 range provide “filesystem” interaction, 3000 handle “shell” commands, and 4000 handle network tunneling."
Sentence 106,"table 1: list of commands supported by the malware
code	command
0000	system information
0008	update
0009	uninstall
1000	ping
1010	install lkm

4001	portmap (proxy)
4002	kill portmap
system information
when the malware first contacts the c2 server it sends a password encoded in the request body."
Sentence 107,the c2 server responds with the command code 0 to collect system information.
Sentence 108,the data collected about the system by the malware is listed in the table below.
Sentence 109,"the data is serialized into a url query-like string, encrypted and then sent as the request body."
Sentence 110,"table 2: data collected by the malware and sent back to the c2 server
url key	description	comment
hostip	ip	hardcoded to 127.0.0.1
softtype		hardcoded to “linux”
pscaddr	mac address	
hostname	machine name	
hosttar	username	possibly “host target”
hostos	distribution	extracted from /etc/issue or /etc/redhat-release
hostcpu	clock speed	/proc/cpuinfo
hostmem	amount of memory	/proc/meminfo
hostpack		hardcoded to “linux”
lkmtag	is rootkit enabled	
kernel	kernel version	extracted from unamefigure 12 shows the communication between redxor and the c2."
Sentence 111,the malware sends the password “pd=admin” and c2 responds with “all right” (jsessionid=0000).
Sentence 112,"next, the malware sends the system information and the c2 replies with the ping command (jsessionid=1000)."
Sentence 113,"figure 12: redxor communication with c2
"
Sentence 114,"
update functionality
the malware can be updated by the threat actor."
Sentence 115,this is performed by sending command code 8 to the malware.
Sentence 116,"when the malware receives this code the following actions are taken:
the malware opens the mutex file for writing."
Sentence 117,it sends a request with the command code 8 and an empty request body to the c2 server.
Sentence 118,the response body from the server is written to the mutex file.
Sentence 119,the response body is not encrypted.
Sentence 120,the lock is released on the mutex file.
Sentence 121,the malware executes “chmod” to set the execution flag on the file via the libc system function.
Sentence 122,the malware sleeps and tries to obtain the lock on the file again when it wakes up.
Sentence 123,"if it fails, it assumes the update was successful, closes the connection to the c2 server and exits."
Sentence 124,"shell functionality
the malware has the ability to provide its operator with a “tty” shell."
Sentence 125,"if a shell is requested via the command code 3000, the malware creates a new thread executing “/bin/sh”."
Sentence 126,"in the new spawned shell, the malware executes python -c “import pty;pty.spawn(‘/bin/sh’)” to get a pseudo-terminal (pty) interface."
Sentence 127,any shell commands sent to the malware with the command code of 3058 are executed in the pty and the response is returned to the operator.
Sentence 128,"network tunneling
network tunneling is enabled by sending the command code 4001 to the malware."
Sentence 129,"as part of the request, a “configuration” is sent as part of the response body."
Sentence 130,the configuration consists of three items separated by a “#” character.
Sentence 131,"the items are: a port to bind to, the ip to connect to, and a port to connect to."
Sentence 132,the malware uses a modified version of the open-source project rinetd for the tunneling logic.
Sentence 133,rinetd is designed to use a configuration file stored on the machine.
Sentence 134,"to get around this, the malware author has modified the function that parses the configuration in order to directly take the required values normally found in the configuration file."
Sentence 135,"detection & response
detect if a machine in your network has been compromised
use a cloud workload protection platform like intezer protect to gain full runtime visibility over the code in your linux-based systems and get alerted on any malicious or unauthorized code or commands."
Sentence 136,try our free community edition figure 13 emphasizes an intezer protect alert on a compromised machine.
Sentence 137,"the alert provides additional context about the malicious code including threat classification (redxor), binary’s path on the disk, process tree, command, and hash."
Sentence 138,"figure 13: intezer protect alerts on redxor
"
Sentence 139,"
we also recommend using the iocs section below to ensure that the redxor process and the files it creates do not exist on your system."
Sentence 140,"response
if you are a victim of this operation, take the following steps:
kill the process and delete all files related to the malware."
Sentence 141,make sure your machine is clean and running only trusted code using a cloud workload protection platform like intezer protect.
Sentence 142,"wrap up
linux systems are under constant attack given that linux runs on most of the public cloud workload."
Sentence 143,a survey conducted by sophos found that 70% of organizations using the public cloud to host data or workloads experienced a security incident in the past year.
Sentence 144,"along with botnets and cryptominers, the linux threat landscape is also home to sophisticated threats like redxor developed by nation-state actors."
Sentence 145,redxor samples are indexed in intezer analyze so that you can detect any suspicious file that shares code with this malware.
