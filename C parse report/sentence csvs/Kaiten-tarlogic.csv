Sentence 1,"Attackers Abuse MobileIron’s RCE to deliver Kaiten
13 - Oct - 2020 - Borja Merino
"
Sentence 2,"
In September this year the security researcher Orange Tsai published various vulnerabilities and P0Cs related to the MobileIron’s mobile Device Management (MDM) solution."
Sentence 3,"The Tarlogic Blue Team has identified the use of CVE-2020-15505 by a certain group of attackers to download and run Kaiten
"
Sentence 4,"
Kaiten (aka Tsunami)
Through the JNDI injection related to said CVE, the attackers are downloading the well-known Kaiten."
Sentence 5,"This family of malware has been used by multiple actors for more than 15 years (its beginnings date back to 2002) mainly as an offensive tool to generate DoS attacks and, currently, for the mining of cryptocurrencies."
Sentence 6,There are dozens of variants associated with this malicious code; possibly as a result of the publication of its source code.
Sentence 7,"In February 2016, a variant of Kaiten was distributed by a group of cybercriminals through malicious ISO images after compromising an instance of Linux Mint WordPress and modify its download URLs."
Sentence 8,"Another variant, dubbed Amnesia in April 2017 by PaloAlto, was related to the infection of multiple CCTV-DVR systems around the world by taking advantage of a certain RCE vulnerability that affected more than 70 vendors."
Sentence 9,"In April 2018, Netlab 360 researchers identified a botnet (nicknamed Muhstik) also linked to this malicious code that used a certain Drupal vulnerability as the input vector."
Sentence 10,The capabilities of this malware are mainly focused on denial of service attacks by implementing various functions to do TCP/UDP flooding to the victims; all instructed by means of the IRC protocol.
Sentence 11,Attackers also have the ability to execute commands and download files.
Sentence 12,"
Malware characteristics:
The binary identified in one of our clients corresponds to 969013b23e440fe31be70daac6d7edb2."
Sentence 13,"Its download originates from a certain dropper developed in bash whose goal is, in the first place, to kill multiple processes related to miners and services that require a high level of CPU."
Sentence 14,"Figure 1. bot_kill function
Once these processes are finished, the script downloads, via “curl”, the Kaiten malware from the URL https://lib.pygensim.com/gensim in the directory defined by the INSTALL variable (/var/tmp/systemd-private-c15c0d5284bd838c15fd0d6c5c2b50bb-systemd-resolved.service-xCkB12/jf2fa44a/aPs52s/jKal2d), it sets execution permissions and finally runs it under the name of “kworker”."
Sentence 15,Figure 2.
Sentence 16,"Tsunami execution
The signature of the harmful code is as follows:

MD5: 969013b23e440fe31be70daac6d7edb2
SHA1: 5369a0122fd3b75ffdd110cc86ccc2d8ae2fa130
SHA256: 0c27c64fc118ef56048b7d994162c4a0d008b4582c5eeb6923949a286f45ec52
"
Sentence 17,"
The file is an elf x64 binary compiled with GCC (Alpine 9.3.0)."
Sentence 18,The following image shows its static properties from the information of its headers.
Sentence 19,Figure 3.
Sentence 20,"ELF information: kworker
By analyzing the strings embedded within the binary it can be quickly inferred that the sample corresponds to Kaiten."
Sentence 21,In the following image you can see the strings associated with the help menu where some of the IRC NOTICE messages that will be used to report the status and actions of the bot are shown.
Sentence 22,Figure 4.
Sentence 23,"Strings binary vs source code Kaiten
"
Sentence 24,"
By reverse engineering it,  we can confirm that the malware author compiled the publicly available sources without hardly modifying the logic of their functions:

Figure 5."
Sentence 25,"Function structure
The binary, after executing, makes a fork() call and later tries to establish communication with the control server using the IRC protocol."
Sentence 26,"To do this, it generates a random nickname/user and connects to certain channel waiting to receive the instructions from their operators."
Sentence 27,Figure 6.
Sentence 28,"Fork y C&C connection
The code implements various functions to carry out different types of denial of service attacks (SYN / UDP flooding, etc.)."
Sentence 29,"The following image shows the logic to execute one of them, specifically, the so-called Tsunami attack."
Sentence 30,"The operators will instruct the bots to execute, for a certain time (set in seconds), a DOS TCP attack playing with various flags of this protocol."
Sentence 31,Figure 7.
Sentence 32,"Tsunami (DOS)
The malicious code also has the ability to execute commands on the victim via the “SH” command."
Sentence 33,"To do this, first, it adds the command to execute in the $PATH env variable and then makes use of popen() to run it."
Sentence 34,Figure 8.
Sentence 35,"Command execution
Another Kaiten’s features is downloading files via HTTP."
Sentence 36,The following image shows the function responsible for this logic.
Sentence 37,Observe the strings associated to the GET request (with the “hardcoded” headers) with which the bot requests to download files to the system.
Sentence 38,Figure 9.
Sentence 39,"Command execution
"
Sentence 40,"
Communications
Kaiten’s dropper as well as the IRC control server share the same malicious domain: lib.pygensim.com

This was created on October 2, 2020 (a few days before the incident) and currently resolves to the address 198.98.56.111 (belonging to the bulletproof host “FranTech solutions”)."
Sentence 41,Figure 10.
Sentence 42,"Whois domain: pygensim.com
According to the information indexed by Shodan the server corresponds to a Debian 10 with ports 22 (SSH) and 443 exposed to Internet."
Sentence 43,Note that Shodan correctly identifies the IRC server running on socket 443.
Sentence 44,Figure 11.
Sentence 45,"Shodan information
The following image shows the bot’s connection to the IRC server (UnrealIRCd 5.0.6) and the entry to the #internet channel (with the password “:key_of_channel”)."
Sentence 46,The creation date of this server was October 4 at 6:12 PM PDT.
Sentence 47,Figure 12.
Sentence 48,"IRC server connection
It should be noted that the IRC server was active during the sample analysis and had about 300 bots."
Sentence 49,Figura 13.
Sentence 50,"Active bots
In the previous output you can see the “Network Administrator” of this server under the nickname “magician”."
Sentence 51,Figura 14.
Sentence 52,"Magician (Network Administrator)
"

It is recommended to filter the domain linked to the C&C (lib.pygensim.com) and establish rules in the corresponding networking devices (firewalls, IDS / IPS) to identify outgoing IRC traffic as this is a protocol rarely used in business environments."
