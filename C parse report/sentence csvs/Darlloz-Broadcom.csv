Sentence 1,"IoT Worm Used to Mine Cryptocurrency 

Mar 19, 2014 08:58 AM

Last November, we found an Internet of Things (IoT) worm named Linux.Darlloz."
Sentence 2,The worm targets computers running Intel x86 architectures.
Sentence 3,"Not only that, but the worm also focuses on devices running the ARM, MIPS and PowerPC architectures, which are usually found on routers and set-top boxes."
Sentence 4,"Since the initial discovery of Linux.Darlloz, we have found a new variant of the worm in mid-January."
Sentence 5,"According to our analysis, the author of the worm continuously updates the code and adds new features, particularly focusing on making money with the worm."
Sentence 6,"By scanning the entire Internet IP address space in February, we found that there were more than 31,000 devices infected with Linux.Darlloz."
Sentence 7,"Coin mining
In addition, we have discovered the current purpose of the worm is to mine cryptocurrencies."
Sentence 8,"Once a computer running Intel architecture is infected with the new variant, the worm installs cpuminer, an open source coin mining software."
Sentence 9,The worm then starts mining Mincoins or Dogecoins on infected computers.
Sentence 10,"By the end of February 2014, the attacker mined 42,438 Dogecoins (approximately US$46 at the time of writing) and 282 Mincoins (approximately US$150 at the time of writing)."
Sentence 11,"These amounts are relatively low for the average cybercrime activity so, we expect the attacker to continue to evolve their threat for increased monetization."
Sentence 12,The worm’s new coin mining feature only affects computers running the Intel x86 architecture and we haven't seen it impact IoT devices.
Sentence 13,These devices typically require more memory and a powerful CPU for coin mining.
Sentence 14,Why Mincoin and Dogecoin?
Sentence 15,"The worm appears to aim at mining Mincoins and Dogecoins, rather than focusing on the well-known and more valuable cryptocurrency Bitcoin."
Sentence 16,"The reason for this is Mincoin and Dogecoin use the scrypt algorithm, which can still mine successfully on home PCs whereas Bitcoin requires custom ASIC chips to be profitable."
Sentence 17,"New targets
The initial version of Darlloz has nine combinations of user names and passwords for routers and set-top boxes."
Sentence 18,"The latest version now has 13 of these login credential combinations, which also work for IP cameras, typically used for remote monitoring of premises."
Sentence 19,Why IoT devices?
Sentence 20,The Internet of Things is all about connected devices of all types.
Sentence 21,"While many users may ensure that their computers are secure from attack, users may not realize that their IoT devices need to be protected too."
Sentence 22,"Unlike regular computers, a lot of IoT devices ship with a default user name and password and many users may not have changed these."
Sentence 23,"As a result, the use of default user names and passwords is one of the top attack vectors against IoT devices."
Sentence 24,Many of these devices also contain unpatched vulnerabilities users are unaware of.
Sentence 25,"While this particular threat focuses on computers, routers, set-top boxes and IP cameras, the worm could be updated to target other IoT devices in the future, such as home automation devices and wearable technology."
Sentence 26,"Blocking other attackers
As described in a previous blog, the worm prevents other attackers or worms, such as Linux.Aidra, from targeting devices already compromised with Linux.Darlloz."
Sentence 27,The malware author implemented this feature into the worm when it was released last November.
Sentence 28,"In early January, there were reports about a back door on a number of routers."
Sentence 29,"By using the back door, remote attackers could gain access to the routers, allowing them to compromise the user’s network."
Sentence 30,"For Darlloz’ author, this represented a threat, so they implemented a feature to block the access to the back door port by creating a new firewall rule on infected devices to ensure that no other attackers can get in through the same back door."
Sentence 31,"Infections in the wild
Once a device is infected, Darlloz starts a HTTP Web server on port 58455 in order to spread."
Sentence 32,The server hosts worm files and lets anyone download files through this port by using a HTTP GET request.
Sentence 33,We searched for IP addresses that open this port and host Darlloz files on static paths.
Sentence 34,"Assuming that the Darlloz worm can be downloaded, we tried to collect OS finger prints of the host server."
Sentence 35,The following statistics give an overview of the infection.
Sentence 36,"There were 31,716 identified IP addresses that were infected with Darlloz."
Sentence 37,Darlloz infections affected 139 regions.
Sentence 38,There were 449 identified OS finger prints from infected IP addresses.
Sentence 39,43 percent of Darlloz infections compromised Intel based-computers or servers running on Linux.
Sentence 40,"38 percent of Darlloz infections seem to have affected a variety of IoT devices, including routers, set-top boxes, IP cameras, and printers."
Sentence 41,"DarllozPie.png

Figure 1."
Sentence 42,"The top five regions with Darlloz infections

The five regions that accounted for 50 percent of all Darlloz infections were China, the US, South Korea, Taiwan and India."
Sentence 43,The reason for the high infections in these regions is most likely due to their large volumes of Internet users or the penetration of IoT devices.
Sentence 44,"Infected IoT devices
Consumers may not realize that their IoT devices could be infected with malware."
Sentence 45,"As a result, this worm managed to compromise 31,000 computers and IoT devices in four months and it is still spreading."
Sentence 46,We expect that the malware author will continue to update this worm with new features as the technology landscape changes over time.
Sentence 47,Symantec will continue to keep an eye on this threat.
Sentence 48,"Mitigation

Apply security patches for all software installed on computers or IoT devices
Update firmware on all devices
Change the password from default on all devices
Block the connection on port 23 or 80 from outside if not required"
