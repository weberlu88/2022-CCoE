summary
mirai is a malware that turns networked devices running linux into remotely controlled bots that can be used as part of a botnet in large-scale network attacks."
Sentence 2,it primarily targets online consumer devices such as ip cameras and home routers.
Sentence 3,"the mirai botnet was first found in august 2016 by malwaremustdie, a whitehat malware research group, and has been used in some of the largest and most disruptive distributed denial of service (ddos)."
Sentence 4,mirai was named after the 2011 tv anime series mirai nikki.
Sentence 5,the source code for mirai was published on hack forums as open-source.
Sentence 6,"since the source code was published, the techniques have been adapted in other malware projects."
Sentence 7,the new mirai variant named mukashi is attacking network-attached storage (nas) devices.
Sentence 8,"mukashi takes advantage of a vulnerability, cve-2020-9054, found in zyxel nas devices which allows remote attackers to execute malicious codes into the affected system."
Sentence 9,it uses brute force attacks through default credentials to log into zyxel nas products.
Sentence 10,"when logged in successfully, the attackers can now take control of the devices and add them to a botnet that can be used to perform distributed denial of service (ddos) attacks."
Sentence 11,mukashi retains the ability of communicating to a command-and-control server.
Sentence 12,"this backdoor gathers the following information and sends it to its servers:

user/device information (ip address, port, username, password)
behaviour

brute force
communicates to a command-and-control server
capabilities

exploits
information theft
backdoor commands
impact

exploits - takes advantage of a software vulnerability or security flaw and can be used to remotely access a network and gain elevated privileges or move deeper into the network
compromise system security - with backdoor capabilities that can execute malicious commands
violation of user privacy - gathers user credentials and steals user information
