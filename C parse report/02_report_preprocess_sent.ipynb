      "Sentence 6: “A shell command was remotely executed to download and execute a malicious shell script (Trojan.SH.LODEX.J), which in turn downloaded another shell script (Trojan.SH.DOGOLOAD.J) that finally installed the AESDDoS botnet malware on the affected system.”\n",

      "Sentence 8: Once the malware has infected a system, it can gather system information, including model ID and CPU description, speed, family, model, and type.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence 9: The AESDDoS bot uses the AES algorithm to encrypt gathered data and data received from the C2 server.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence 10: Trend Micro researchers also discovered that the latest variant of the AESDDoS bot can modify files i.e., /etc/rc.local and /etc/rc.d/rc.local, as an autostart technique by appending the {malware path}/{malware file name} reboot command.\n",
