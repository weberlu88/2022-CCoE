/cgi-bin/php
/cgi-bin/php5
/cgi-bin/php-cgi
/cgi-bin/php.cgi
/cgi-bin/php4

~~
It uses the following list of user names and passwords to access the locations mentioned above in case they are password-protected:

dreambox
smcadmin

~~
It loads the following modules (iptables):

/lib/modules/{kernel version}/kernel/net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_tables.ko
