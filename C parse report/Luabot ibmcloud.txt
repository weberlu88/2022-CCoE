LuaBot Linux/IoT Malware

Timeframe
Researchers discovered this malware at the end of August, 2016.
Attacks continue in September, 2016.
This malware breaks new ground, using Lua compiled to ELF binaries as its development platform. When originally disclosed on 5 September 2016, virtually no anti-virus software detected it, though that situation improved quickly once the malware was publicized.

LuaBot was discovered quite recently and appears to be in relatively early stages of development. It is very modular, and researchers have only disclosed analyses of the base malware and one module. That module focuses on Layer 7 flood DDoS attacks, but other modules could exist or be created. The binaries identified so far are compiled for 32-bit ARM platforms, targeting Linux servers and IoT devices.

The base malware creates a SOCKS proxy on the victim. The creator and operator of LuaBot appears to offer the SOCKS proxies of this botnet for sale to help other malware operations shield the origins of their attacks.

The initial infection vector for LuaBot is currently unknown.

Identifiers
LuaBot
Linux/LuaBot
~~
Known Campaigns
Unidentified.
~~
Behaviors
Implements a Lua scripting environment, including statically linked libraries for networking and cryptography.
Provides a modular platform that allows creation and deployment of new functionality with relative ease.
The only known module performs Layer 7 DDoS attacks.
Acts as a SOCKS proxy.
Signed by an example certificate from the library it uses for SSL communications (MatrixSSL).
Command and Control traffic is encrypted and signed to discourage both detection and hijacking.
Looks up well known sites like amazon[.]com, facebook[.]com, google[.]com, and baidu[.]com to determine whether it can connect to the Internet.
