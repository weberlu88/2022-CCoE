Dofloo-Securityaffairs,48080,7,the malware also connects to 23.224.59.34:48080 to send and receive remote shell commands from the attacker.

Dofloo-SyscallParty,/proc/self/exe,27,the main method then branches to function named get_executable_name which reads the symlink /proc/self/exe via readlink(..).
Dofloo-SyscallParty,/etc,36,"persistence
persistence is achieved by the malware by adding to /etc/rc.local and the /etc/init.d/boot.local files (in the auto_boot function); however before it overwrites this file it first checks to see if it has already done so."

Dofloo-SyscallParty,/proc/net/dev,53,the way the malware gets information regarding the network adapter is reading the /proc/net/dev file.
Dofloo-SyscallParty,uname,77,"we can see that if the ‘uname’ call fails then “unknown” will be copied into the destination buffer which originally resided in r11, else if it is successful, will branch to 0xca8c."
Dofloo-SyscallParty,/proc/cpuinfo,80,the virtual file /proc/cpuinfo is opened and read in words until an eof (-1) is hit whilst reading the file chunk by chunk — then fclose is called to free up the opened file.
Dofloo-SyscallParty,sysinfo,82,the malware then calls sysinfo(..) and reads into the struct (also named sysinfo) which is originally located in r3.
